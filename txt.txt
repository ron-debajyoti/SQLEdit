2nd yr winter holidays... 
group of 7 of us (4 boys + 3 girls) wanted to drink. Bars were full. Some idiot in our group had the great idea of drinking on top of our academic building kyukyi full moon night. Baaki hum ch*tiye agreed. So we went to the rooftop of the academic building and started drinking with 1 girl sober (so that no one falls off the roof lol).

I distinctly remember showing my friend the moon when suddenly i saw another moon. Looking closely, it was a flashlight with 3 guards. Bole neeche Director and Dean bula rhe kyuki itna shor macha rhe ho. One of the guy ( a phd senior at that time) fell in front of the guards begging for forgiveness. Meanwhile I realised its time to escape and slowly slid away.

The thing is our main academic building has 4 floors separated by regions which were locked off, and the ground floor has opening 2 ways ( a back and front exit ) so while frantically tried to escape in each floor , I realized no option. Meanwhile the other 4 boys joined me and as soon as we reached the ground floor, we dashed in different directions in the back. I still remember the guard whistling ki kaha bhaag rhe ho. Each of us 4 boys ran and went towards a different department and luckily the guards decided it wasn't worth chasing us and left off the girls kyuki there was no Diro or Dean (around 11 pm ko nhi the luckily) and the girls ID nhi laaye the to note down the real names.
